*__Group Project Retrospective__*  

My first contribution to the project was to help draft the visual design of our page, including the orientation of images and text. I provided the initial code for the bookshelf, with a teammate providing the books. Later on, I helped talk through strategies for working around various difficulties encountered in building our page.  

I feel that my role in the project was characterized more by abstract thinking and planning than by technical accomplishment. I did well at communicating with my teammates and establishing our priorities in a collaborative way. I would have liked to have been able to contribute to the strict coding aspects of the task to a greater extent. I worked continuously to find ways to bring value to the team despite lacking the programming skills of some of my classmates.  

This project forced me to practice asking for help more than is comfortable for me. It also increased my confidence in working with command prompt and GitHub, though I could certainly still make improvements in both areas.
